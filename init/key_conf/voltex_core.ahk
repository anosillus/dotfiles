; Colemak layout for AutoHotkey (MS Windows)
; 2006-01-01 Shai Coleman, http://colemak.com/ . Public domain.
; See http://www.autohotkey.com/ for more information

; For this to work you have to make sure that the US (QWERTY) layout is installed,
; that is set as the default layout, and that it is set as the current layout.
; Otherwise some of the key mappings will be wrong.
;
; This is mainly useful for those who don't have privileges to install a new layout
; This doesn't support the international features of the Colemak layout.

#SingleInstance force
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetTitleMatchMode 3  ; Exact matching to avoid confusing T/B with Tab/Backspace.

; If the script is not elevated, relaunch as administrator and kill current instance:

full_command_line := DllCall("GetCommandLine", "str")

if not (A_IsAdmin or RegExMatch(full_command_line, " /restart(?!\S)"))
{
    try ; leads to having the script re-launching itself as administrator
    {
        if A_IsCompiled
            Run *RunAs "%A_ScriptFullPath%" /restart
        else
            Run *RunAs "%A_AhkPath%" /restart "%A_ScriptFullPath%"
    }
    ExitApp
